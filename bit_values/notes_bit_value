Notes Building Values from Bits:

For the first task was to set the x = 2695506604, which was done by using the bitwise |. After that the second task was to toggle bit 3, it was done by using bitwise ^ 
and 1<<3 toggle by 3 and do the same step for the next task. After that the fourth
task was to clear bit 7 which was done by using bitwise & operand and ~. The last 
task was to clear bits from 16-31, that was bit confusing since it involved two 
digits unlike one for the last few tasks, I didn't quite get the results for the 
16-31 bits since I tried couple different methods using OR opeators but didn't find 
any luck.
