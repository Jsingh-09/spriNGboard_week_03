Notes for Integer Divison:

1. For the first part the of the code the setw(5) sets the width of the integer.
after that there is a for loop that goes from 1 to 10 and increment until it equal
or greator than 10. Both the side of the code started from 1 and went to 10 and all
the number had a positive infront of them because of the showpos where it always
displays the negative number with the positive sign. The results were as expected 
showing if divisible mostly 1s and no decimal since it's an integer.

Changing the code to work from [-10,+10] but I ran across an error "floating point
exception (core dumped), while looking into it, the error was related to the 0
in the numenator and denominator which is impossible to do if trying to divide
a number by 0.
