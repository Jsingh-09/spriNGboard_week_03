Overflow and Underflow:

1. For the first part of the code it was to initialize 32-bit signed and unsigned 
integers. The result were not surprising at all since signed Interger can have the 
negative and the positive value. When the signed integer that was initialized to 0 
had an decrement to it, it went from being 0 to -1 which makes sense since it has 
negative value where the unsigned integer went from being 0 to 18446..... to a positive 
number which is the maximum it can hold.

2. For the second one the task was to initialize 16-bit signed and unsigned integers
to their maximum values. For the signed integer it showed a negative value from being 
32767 to -32768, since the signed integer has the negative value after its maximum 
positive number but for the unsigned interger it showed a positive number from 32767 to
32768 which makes sense since it showed the positive number instead of a negative since
the unsigned doesn't have negative values.
